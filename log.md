# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: september 13, 2022


**Today's Progress**: fetched data from an API using useSWR.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled using useSWR,because it was first using it but after a lot searching and reading, I was able to finally fetch data .

**Link to work:** [myunsplash App](not yet live).
